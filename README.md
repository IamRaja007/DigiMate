# DigiMate
Introducing _DigiMate_, an online class managing app. One can find almost everything that is needed for proper functioning of regular classes. </br>

 * _DigiMate_ has a **Attendence section**. Now forget calling out students' name for attendence, and let DigiMate manage the attendence. A faculty </br>can login to the app and create a class providing the topic name, meeting link and time for the meeting.
   When a student joins the class he/she </br>gets directed to the meeting and the attendence is registered in Google Sheets and the faculty can easily download day's attendence in any format </br> from that sheet.

 * _DigiMate_ also has a **Learning section**, where a faculty can add notes in the form of image or pdf that he wants to share with his students, and </br>students can download the notes as well. One can write a reply or ask follow-up doubts or questions regarding a particular note.

 * _DigiMate_ also has a **Proctoring section**, where a student can ask queries to their respective proctors, thus making Proctoring easy. Also, </br>one's query is visible to his/her respective proctor only to which the latter can reply too.

 * _DigiMate_ also has a **Profile section** in which, the user can see its profile details. If student logins, he can see his profile along with his </br>assigned proctor. And if Faculty logins, then they can see their profile details along with the students that are under their mentorship.
